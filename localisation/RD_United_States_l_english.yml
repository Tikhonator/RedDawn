 # LEADER DESCRIPTIONS
 POLITICS_RONALD_REAGAN_DESC:0 "Ronald Wilson Reagan is the current United States president and former Governor of California/Actor. Reagan was raised in a low-income family in small towns of northern Illinois. He graduated from Eureka College in 1932 and worked as a radio sports commentator. After moving to California in 1937, he found work as an actor and starred in a few major productions. As president of the Screen Actors Guild, Reagan worked to root out communist influence. In the 1950s, he moved into television and was a motivational speaker at General Electric factories. In 1964, his speech "A Time for Choosing" earned him national attention as a new conservative spokesman. Building a network of supporters, Reagan was elected governor of California in 1966. As governor, he raised taxes, turned a state budget deficit to a surplus, challenged the protesters at UC Berkeley, and ordered in National Guard troops during a period of protest movements. In 1980, Reagan won the Republican presidential nomination and defeated the incumbent president, Jimmy Carter. Immediately on taking office as president, Reagan began implementing sweeping new political and economic initiatives that were highly popular among conservatives but denounced by liberals. Reagan won over enough conservative Democrats to pass his program through Congress. Economic conditions had deteriorated under Carter, with slow growth and high inflation. Reagan promised that his supply-side economic policies, dubbed "Reaganomics", would turn around the economy with lower tax rates, economic deregulation, and reduction in government spending. On the eve of the Soviet invasion of North America, Reagan, Vice President Bush, the Reagan and Bush family, and parts of the Reagan Administration were evacuated from D.C with news that a Soviet ICBM was enroute to being dropped on Washington, D.C. Reagan ordered the evacuations of Portland, Las Vegas, Grand Falls, Omaha, Kansas City, Atlanta, Washington, D.C, and Boston (cities that were being targeted by Soviet ICBM's). When the Reagans, Bushes, and parts of the Reagan Admninistration arrive at Mount Weather, the nukes arrived, destroying those 8 major cities. Now, the Reagans and Bushes are living their lives in an underground bunker."
