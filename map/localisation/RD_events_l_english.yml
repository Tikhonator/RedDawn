 lar_collab_gov.1.d:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] have recently increased their efforts to build collaboration within our nation. A number of [This.GetAdjective] politicians have started speaking rather sympathetically about the [From.GetAdjective] regime, and many partisans within our nation are turning their [From.GetRulingIdeology] sentiment into direct support for [From.GetNameDef].\n\nThe growing [From.GetAdjective] influence in our nation will undoubtedly lower [Root.GetAdjective] resistance and may even lead to a new [From.GetRulingIdeology] government in collaboration with [From.GetNameDef] in the event that [Root.GetNameDef] should capitulate."
