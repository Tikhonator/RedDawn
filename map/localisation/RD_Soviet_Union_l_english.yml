An autopsy was performed with the cause of death being declared as a combination of chronic emphysema, an enlarged and damaged heart, congestive heart failure, and liver cirrhosis. The Americans might already know about Comrade Chernenko's death. We are in the process of figuring out who will be the successor to Chernenko.

 # NATIONAL SPIRITS
 economic_collapse:0 "Economic Collapse"
 economic_collapse_desc:0 "In recent years, the Soviet Economy has been showing signs of an potential collapse. Our GDP has slowed down between 1973 to 1984. Our economic growth rates have dropped. Many in the West are predicting an economic collapse in the late 80's but why should we care in Soviet Russia? Nothing can go wrong with our glorious economy."
 ukrainian_harvest_failure:0 "Ukrainian Wheat Harvest Failure"
 ukrainian_harvest_failure_desc:0 "Recently in the Ukrainian SSR, the seasonal wheat harvest has turned into a disaster. The weather in agricultural regions of the Ukrainian SSR have been horrible, causing extremely bad damage for wheat. Due to this, a lack in bread and other products containing wheat have turned up all over the Soviet Union. Some in the Eastern Bloc such as Poland and Romania have reported a lack in products containing wheat. All of us in the Eastern Bloc wonder, when could this end?""
